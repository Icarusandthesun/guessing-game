    <h1>Guessing Game</h1>
    <h2>My Bio</h2>
    <p>I was born in Portland, a great many years ago. Other than five years in the Navy, I've lived here in Portland all of my life. I'm married to an amazing woman and have two wonderfully strong willed daughters who are making their way in their adult lives.</p>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>I am an advertising photographer, currently managing a photography studio for a marketing company here in Portland. I became interested in photography at a young age. My earliers influence was my grandfather who had a lifelong interest as an amateur photographer. My father, a graphic designer, gave me my first job as a photographing products for catalogs he designed. After high school, I spent five years as a Navy photographer, where I traveled a lot, got married and finally returned home to Portland. After the Navy, I went to college and have been working as a commercial photographer since.</p>
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I finished my bachelor's degree at PSU a really long time ago. My focus was fine arts and literature. After that, I spent three years studing graphic design at PNCA.</p>
    <h2>Cheers!<br>Jerry</h2>
